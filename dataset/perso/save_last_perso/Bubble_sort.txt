Bubble sort: 
	A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares pairs of adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 
	This continues until the list is fully sorted.
	
pseudo code Bubble sort

Here is an example of pseudo code for a bubble sort algorithm:

Copy code
procedure bubbleSort(A: list of sortable items)
    n = length(A)
    repeat
        swapped = false
        for i = 1 to n-1 inclusive do
            /* if this pair is out of order */
            if A[i-1] > A[i] then
                /* swap them and remember something changed */
                swap(A[i-1], A[i])
                swapped = true
            end if
        end for
    until not swapped
end procedure

This algorithm repeatedly loops through the list of items, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 
It continues looping until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.

Note that this is just an example of one way to implement a bubble sort, and there may be other ways to write this algorithm in pseudo code.

bubble sort in python
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly iterates through a list of items, compares adjacent items, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This continues until the list is fully sorted.

Here is an example of how to implement bubble sort in Python:

Copy code
def bubble_sort(items):
    # Iterate over the entire list of items
    for i in range(len(items)):
        # For each item, iterate over the rest of the list and compare
        # adjacent items. If the items are out of order, swap them.
        for j in range(i+1, len(items)):
            if items[j] < items[i]:
                items[i], items[j] = items[j], items[i]
    return items
To use this implementation, you can simply call bubble_sort() on the list of items you want to sort. For example:

Copy code
items = [5, 3, 2, 4, 1]
sorted_items = bubble_sort(items)
print(sorted_items)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Note that bubble sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm, especially for large lists of items. For better performance, you may want to use a faster sorting algorithm such as quicksort or merge sort.
