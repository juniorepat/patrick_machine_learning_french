Merge sort: 
	A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively breaks the input list down into smaller lists
	, sorts those smaller lists, and then merges the sorted lists back together to form the final sorted list.
	
pseudo code Merge  sort

Here is an example of pseudo code for a merge sort algorithm:

Copy code
procedure mergeSort(A: list of sortable items)
    if length(A) > 1 then
        /* divide the list into two equal-sized sublists */
        middle = length(A) / 2
        left = A[0..middle]
        right = A[middle..length(A)-1]
        /* recursively sort the two sublists */
        mergeSort(left)
        mergeSort(right)
        /* merge the now-sorted sublists */
        merge(left, right, A)
    end if
end procedure

procedure merge(left, right, A)
    /* create three index variables to keep track of the current position in the sublists */
    i = 0
    j = 0
    k = 0
    while i < length(left) and j < length(right) do
        if left[i] <= right[j] then
            A[k] = left[i]
            i = i + 1
        else
            A[k] = right[j]
            j = j + 1
        end if
        k = k + 1
    end while
    /* copy any remaining elements of left */
    while i < length(left) do
        A[k] = left[i]
        i = i + 1
        k = k + 1
    end while
    /* copy any remaining elements of right */
    while j < length(right) do
        A[k] = right[j]
        j = j + 1
        k = k + 1
    end while
end procedure

This algorithm works by recursively dividing the input list into smaller and smaller sublists until each sublist has only one element, which is inherently sorted. 
It then merges the sublists together in a way that preserves their sorted order to produce the final, sorted list.

As with the other examples, this is just one way to write a merge sort algorithm in pseudo code, and there may be other variations.

Merge  sort in python
Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort a list of items. The algorithm works by dividing the list of items into two smaller sub-lists, sorting each sub-list, and then merging the two sub-lists back together to form a single, sorted list.

Here is an example of how to implement merge sort in Python:

Copy code
def merge_sort(items):
    # Base case: if the list is empty or has only one item, it is already sorted
    if len(items) <= 1:
        return items

    # Split the list into two equal-sized sub-lists
    mid = len(items) // 2
    left = items[:mid]
    right = items[mid:]

    # Recursively sort the sub-lists
    left = merge_sort(left)
    right = merge_sort(right)

    # Merge the sorted sub-lists back into a single list
    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    # Initialize the resulting list
    result = []

    # Initialize the indices of the left and right sub-lists
    left_idx = 0
    right_idx = 0

    # Loop until one of the sub-lists is empty
    while left_idx < len(left) and right_idx < len(right):
        # If the current item in the left sub-list is smaller than the current
        # item in the right sub-list, append it to the result and increment
        # the left index. Otherwise, do the same for the right sub-list.
        if left[left_idx] <= right[right_idx]:
            result.append(left[left_idx])
            left_idx += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[right_idx])
            right_idx += 1

    # Append any remaining items in the left sub-list to the result
    while left_idx < len(left):
        result.append(left[left_idx])
        left_idx += 1

    # Append any remaining items in the right sub-list to the result
    while right_idx < len(right):
        result.append(right[right_idx])
        right_idx += 1

    # Return the resulting list
    return result
To use this implementation, you can simply call merge_sort() on the list of items you want to sort. For example:

Copy code
items = [5, 3, 2, 4, 1]
sorted_items = merge_sort(items)
print(sorted_items)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Note that this implementation uses the // operator to perform integer division, which means that it will only work in Python 3. In Python 2, you should use the / operator instead.
