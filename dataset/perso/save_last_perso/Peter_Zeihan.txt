Disunited_Nations
significantly
-------------Disunited_Nations-------------

Most countries and companies are not prepared for the world Peter Zeihan says we’re already living in. 

For decades, America’s allies have depended on its might for their economic and physical security. 
But as a new age of American isolationism dawns, the results will surprise everyone. 
In Disunited Nations, geopolitical strategist Peter Zeihan presents a series of counterintuitive arguments about the future of a world 
where TRADE AGREEMENTS ARE COMING APART and INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE LOSING THEIR POWER. 

Germany will decline as the most powerful country in Europe, with France taking its place. 
Every country should prepare for the COLLAPSE OF CHINA, not North Korea. 
We are already seeing, as Zeihan predicts, a SHIFT IN OUTLOOK ON THE MIDDLE EAST: It is NO LONGER IRAN that is the region’s most dangerous threat, but SAUDI ARABIA. 
The world has gotten so accustomed to the “normal” of an AMERICAN-DOMINATED ORDER that we have all forgotten the HISTORICAL NORM: 
SEVERAL SMALLER, COMPETING POWERS And economic systems throughout Europe and Asia. 

AMERICA isn’t the only nation stepping back from the international system. 
From BRAZIL to GREAT BRITAIN to RUSSIA, leaders are deciding that EVEN if plenty of countries lose in the growing DISUNITED CHAOS, their NATIONS WILL BENEFIT. 
The world isn’t falling apart—IT’S BEING PUSHED APART. 
The COUNTRIES and BUSINESSES prepared for this new EVERY-COUNTRY-FOR-ITSELF ethic are those that WILL PREVAIL; 
those shackled to the status quo will find themselves lost in the new world disorder.

Smart, interesting, and essential reading, 
Disunited Nations is a sure-to-be-controversial guidebook that analyzes the EMERGING SHIFTS and RESULTING PROBLEMS that will arise in the NEXT TWO DECADES. 
We are entering a PERIOD OF CHAOS, and no political or corporate leader can ignore Zeihan’s insights or his message if they want to SURVIVE AND THRIVE in this UNCERTAIN NEW TIME.

-------------The Absent Superpower: The Shale Revolution and a World Without America-------------

The world is changing in ways most of us find incomprehensible. 
Terrorism spills out of the Middle East into Europe. 
Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, China and Japan vie to see who can be most aggressive. 
Financial breakdown in Asia and Europe guts growth, challenging hard-won political stability.

Yet for the Americans, these changes are fantastic. 
Alone among the world's powers, only the United States is geographically wealthy, demographically robust, and energy secure. 
That last piece -- American energy security -- is rapidly emerging as the most critical piece of the global picture.

The American shale revolution does more than sever the largest of the remaining ties that bind America's fate to the wider world. 
It re-industrializes the United States, accelerates the global order's breakdown, and triggers a series of wide ranging military conflicts that will shape the next two decades. 

The common theme? 
Just as the global economy tips into chaos
, just as global energy becomes dangerous
, just as the world really needs the Americans to be engaged
, the United States will be...absent.

In 2014's The Accidental Superpower, geopolitical strategist Peter Zeihan made the case that geographic, demographic and energy trends were UNRAVELLING the global system. 
Zeihan takes the story a step further in The Absent Superpower, mapping out the THREATS AND OPPORTUNITIES as the WORLD DESCENDS INTO DISORDER.
