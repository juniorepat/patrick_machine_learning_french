Selection sort: 
	A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted list and adds it to the sorted list.
	
pseudo code Selection sort

Here is an example of pseudo code for a selection sort algorithm:

Copy code
procedure selectionSort(A: list of sortable items)
    n = length(A)
    for i = 1 to n-1 inclusive do
        /* find the minimum element in the unsorted sublist[i, n] */
        min = i
        for j = i+1 to n inclusive do
            if A[j] < A[min] then
                min = j
            end if
        end for
        /* swap the minimum element with A[i] */
        swap(A[i], A[min])
    end for
end procedure

This algorithm works by looping through the list of items
, and at each step it finds the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the current element. 
This continues until all the elements have been sorted.

As with the other examples, this is just one way to write a selection sort algorithm in pseudo code, and there may be other variations.

selection sort in python
Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iterating over a list of items, finding the smallest item, and then placing it at the beginning of the sorted list. 
The algorithm repeats this process until all of the items have been sorted.

Here is an example of how to implement selection sort in Python:

Copy code
def selection_sort(items):
    # Iterate over the entire list of items
    for i in range(len(items)):
        # Find the index of the smallest item in the list
        min_idx = i
        for j in range(i+1, len(items)):
            if items[j] < items[min_idx]:
                min_idx = j

        # Swap the smallest item with the first unsorted item in the list
        items[i], items[min_idx] = items[min_idx], items[i]

    return items
To use this implementation, you can simply call selection_sort() on the list of items you want to sort. For example:

Copy code
items = [5, 3, 2, 4, 1]
sorted_items = selection_sort(items)
print(sorted_items)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Note that selection sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm, especially for large lists of items. For better performance, you may want to use a faster sorting algorithm such as quicksort or merge sort.
