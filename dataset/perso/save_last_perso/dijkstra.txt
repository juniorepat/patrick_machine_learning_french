use cases dijkstra algorithm

The Dijkstra algorithm is a popular and widely used algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. 
Some common use cases for this algorithm include finding the best route for a delivery truck to take between multiple locations, 
determining the fastest way to get from one location to another in a transportation network, and routing data packets efficiently in a computer network. 
The algorithm can also be used in a variety of other scenarios where it is necessary to find the shortest path between two points in a graph.

The pseudo code for the Dijkstra algorithm can be written as follows:

Copy code
function Dijkstra(Graph, source):
    
    create an empty set S

    // Initialize distances from source to all other vertices as infinite and the source itself as 0
    for each vertex v in Graph:
        if v is source:
            dist[v] := 0
        else:
            dist[v] := infinity
            
    // While there are vertices not yet included in the set S
    while S is not complete:
        // Choose the vertex u that is not in S and has the smallest distance from the source
        u := vertex in Graph not in S with smallest dist[] value
        
        // Add u to the set S
        add u to S
        
        // Update distances of all adjacent vertices of u
        for each neighbor v of u:
            if dist[v] > dist[u] + weight(u, v):
                dist[v] := dist[u] + weight(u, v)
    
    // At this point, the distances from the source to all other vertices are finalized
    return dist[]
	
This is a high-level pseudo code and can be implemented in many different ways in different programming languages. 
The basic idea behind the algorithm is to iteratively find the shortest path to all other vertices in the graph, starting from the source vertex. 
It does this by maintaining a set of vertices that have already been visited, and updating the distances of the unvisited vertices based on their distances to the visited vertices. 
The algorithm terminates when all vertices have been visited, at which point the shortest distances to all other vertices are known.
