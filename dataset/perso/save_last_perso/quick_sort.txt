Quick sort: 
	A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that uses a pivot element to partition the input list into two smaller lists
	, and then recursively sorts those lists.
	
pseudo code quick sort
Here is an example of pseudo-code for quicksort:

Copy code
function quicksort(list):
  if list is empty or has only one item:
    return list

  choose a pivot item from the list

  partition the list into two sub-lists:
    - items less than the pivot
    - items greater than or equal to the pivot

  recursively sort the sub-lists

  return the sorted list

In this pseudo-code, the quicksort() function takes a list of items as input and returns a new, sorted list. 
The function uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort the list by choosing a pivot item, partitioning the list into two sub-lists based on their relative position to the pivot, and then recursively sorting the sub-lists. 
This process continues until the entire list is sorted.

Quick sort in python

Quicksort is a sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort a list of items. 
The algorithm works by selecting a pivot item from the list, partitioning the remaining items into two sub-lists based on their relative position to the pivot, and then recursively sorting the sub-lists. 
This process continues until the entire list is sorted.

Here is an example of how to implement quicksort in Python:

Copy code
def quick_sort(items):
    # Base case: if the list is empty or has only one item, it is already sorted
    if len(items) <= 1:
        return items

    # Choose a pivot item (in this case, the first item in the list)
    pivot = items[0]

    # Partition the list into two sub-lists:
    #  - items less than the pivot
    #  - items greater than or equal to the pivot
    left = []
    right = []
    for item in items[1:]:
        if item < pivot:
            left.append(item)
        else:
            right.append(item)

    # Recursively sort the sub-lists
    left = quick_sort(left)
    right = quick_sort(right)

    # Return the sorted list
    return left + [pivot] + right
To use this implementation, you can simply call quick_sort() on the list of items you want to sort. For example:

Copy code
items = [5, 3, 2, 4, 1]
sorted_items = quick_sort(items)
print(sorted_items)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Note that this implementation of quicksort uses the first item in the list as the pivot. 
While this is a simple and effective approach, it is not the most efficient way to choose a pivot, as it can result in unbalanced partitions and poor performance for certain types of input data. 
For better performance, you may want to use a different method for choosing the pivot, such as choosing the median or a random item from the list.
