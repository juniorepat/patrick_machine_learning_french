There are many different sorting algorithms, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some common sorting algorithms include:

Bubble sort
Insertion sort
Selection sort
Merge sort
Quick sort

There are many other sorting algorithms, including more advanced ones that are designed to be efficient for large inputs or specific types of data. 
Choosing the right sorting algorithm depends on the details of the problem you are trying to solve and 
the characteristics of the data you are working with.

Bubble sort: 
	A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares pairs of adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 
	This continues until the list is fully sorted.
Insertion sort: 
	A simple sorting algorithm that builds up the final sorted list one element at a time. 
	At each step, the algorithm takes the next element in the unsorted list and inserts it into the correct position in the sorted list.
Selection sort: 
	A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted list and adds it to the sorted list.
Merge sort: 
	A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively breaks the input list down into smaller lists
	, sorts those smaller lists, and then merges the sorted lists back together to form the final sorted list.
Quick sort: 
	A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that uses a pivot element to partition the input list into two smaller lists
	, and then recursively sorts those lists.
